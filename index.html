    <p>Hello World! My name is Richard Boles and I am currently a personal trainer and uber driver. On my days off I volunteer at my church (Saint Albans Baptist Church) helping at the food pantry and soup kitchen. I have been volunteering for about eight years because I feel giving back to the community is very important. There are many people in need of support and it is a very rewarding feeeling to help the people in my community anyway possible.
    </p>
    <p>I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to join the upcoming cohort of The Knowledge House. Ever since I was introduced to computer programming from my friend who is a professional programmer, I became very passionate and eager to learn and become the best programmer that I can be. I have been studying HTML/CSS and JavaScript on various platforms for the past two years. With the help and support from The Knowledge House I know my skill set will reach higher levels. Upon completion I would definitely like to teach computer programming to the youth all over New York City.   
    </p>

;">My favorite movie is "Social Network" and as a kid I really enjoyed watching "Aladdin". I play basketball very often especially with my little brothers. Some of my other hobbies include lifting weights, church, traveling, spending time with my niece and nephew and teaching myself computer programming. I do not have any social media accounts like Facebook or Instagram. I am old-fashioned and  I like to connect with people the traditional way.
